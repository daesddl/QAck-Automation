Sequence of  instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit.

- **Decomposing** a complex programming task into simpler steps: this is one of the two main tools of structured programming, along with data structures
- **Reducing duplicate code** within a program
- Enabling **reuse** of code across multiple programs
- **Dividing** a large programming task among various programmers or various stages of a project
- **Hiding implementation** details from users of the subroutine
- **Improving readability** of code by replacing a block of code with a function call where a descriptive function name serves to describe the block of code. This makes the calling code concise and readable even if the function is not meant to be reused.
- **Improving traceability** by not decomposing the code into subroutines, debugging would be severely impaired

#### Properties
- Function is an object
- Function is first-class citizen
